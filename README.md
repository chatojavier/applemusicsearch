# Fetching data in React Exercise

<img src="./Screenshot.png" />

This is a proyect for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding.

The objetive of this exercise was lern how to use "useEffect", "useReducer", and how to fetch data from react.

In a second part of the project I implemented a navigation bar with three buttons that bring us two new views: Movies and Books. To do this I used web components (custom elements) and vanilla JS hash routing.

## Usage

This was one of the ReactJS projects developed for the fullstack MITxPro program. In this case, I created a React app to search for Apple Music songs, artists, albums, or music videos. Plus, you have two additional views for searching for books and movies. I used the iTunes Search API for this task.

You could see this app working in this link: https://jbdigital.online/applemusic/
