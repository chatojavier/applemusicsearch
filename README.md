# Fetching data in React Exercise

<img src="./Screenshot.png" />

This is a proyect for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding.

The objetive of this exercise was lern how to use "useEffect", "useReducer", and how to fetch data from react.

In a second part od the project I implement a navigation bar with three buttons witch bring us two new views: Movies and Books. To made it I used Web Components (Custom Elements) and a vanilla JS hash routing.

## Usage

This was one of the javascript projects developed for the fullstack MITxPro program. In this case I used Create React App for search songs, artists, albums or music videos from Apple Music. I used the iTunes Search Api for this task.

You could see this app working in this link: https://jbdigital.online/applemusic/
